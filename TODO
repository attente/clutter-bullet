1. check if the w-coordinate should be 0 or 1 in ClutterBulletMotionState
2. check if it's okay to g_object_unref in clutter_bullet_actor_get_actor
3. find way of obtaining a btMotionState from ClutterBulletActor
4. find way of obtaining a btCollisionShape with mass from ClutterBulletActor
5. implement ClutterContainer add/remove on ClutterBulletGroup
6. figure out how to obtain a ClutterActor's btRigidBody
7. attach to an allocation-changed signal to update the btRigidBody
8. allow getting/setting of scale in ClutterBulletGroup
